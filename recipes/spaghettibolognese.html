<h2>Description</h2>

<ul>
    <li> Step 1
        Put a large saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil
    </li>
    <li>Step 2
        Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 10 mins until golden and crisp.
    </li>
    <li>Step 3
        Reduce the heat and add the 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 2 garlic cloves and the leaves from 2-3 sprigs rosemary,
         all finely chopped, then fry for 10 mins. Stir the veg often until it softens.
    </li>
    <li>Step 4
        Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook stirring for 3-4 mins until the meat is browned all over.

    </li>
    <li>Step 5
        Add 2 tins plum tomatoes, the finely chopped leaves from ¾ small pack basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 bay leaves,
